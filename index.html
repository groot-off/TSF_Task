                <p>
                  The novel human coronavirus disease COVID-19 has become the
                  fifth documented pandemic since the 1918 flu pandemic.
                  COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China, and subsequently
                  spread worldwide. The coronavirus was officially named severe
                  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the
                  International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses based on
                  phylogenetic analysis. SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be a
                  spillover of an animal coronavirus a nd later adapted the
                  ability of human-to-human transmission. Because the virus is
                  highly contagious, it rapidly spreads and continuously evolves
                  in the human population. In this review article, we discuss
                  the basic properties, potential origin, and evolution of the
                  novel human coronavirus. These factors may be critical for
                  studies of pathogenicity, antiviral designs, and vaccine
                  development against the virus.

                <p>
                  India currently has the largest number of confirmed cases in
                  Asia. As of April 2021, India has the second-highest number of
                  confirmed cases in the world (after the United States) with
                  more than 17 million reported cases of COVID-19 infection and
                  211,853 deaths as of 30 April 2021.India, with a population of
                  more than 1.34 billion—the second largest population in the
                  world—will have difficulty in controlling the transmission of
                  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 among its
                  population. Multiple strategies would be highly necessary to
                  handle the current outbreak; these include computational
                  modeling, statistical tools, and quantitative analyses to
                  control the spread as well as the rapid development of a new
                  treatment. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India
                  has raised awareness about the recent outbreak and has taken
                  necessary actions to control the spread of COVID-19.

                Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as before
                and after you take it off, and after you touch it at any time.
                Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin. When you
                take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day
                either wash it if it’s a fabric mask, or dispose of a medical
                mask in a trash bin. Don’t use masks with valves.

                Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol based
                hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your
                hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills

                Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and
                anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or
                sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or
                mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can
                breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the

                to receive the complete schedule of COVID-19 vaccine for
                protecting oneself against this disease and also to limit the
                spread of this disease to the close contacts including family
